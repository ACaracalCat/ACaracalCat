## ⭐️About Me
I'm a programmer with a love for Ragdoll Cats. I started coding in 2017 when I was amazed by the amazing creations you could create with just your keyboard. I love programming for the freedom and creativity you have when developing anything. Programming is one of my favorite hobbies, and I strive to improve daily.
